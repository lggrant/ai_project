### 🌍 RELand AI Web Demo – Landmine Risk Prediction Website

**🔗 Live Demo:**  
[https://Brandon-Tirado.github.io/reland-demo-risk-map/](https://Brandon-Tirado.github.io/reland-demo-risk-map/)

**💬 Prompt Used:**

> Please develop a website using HTML that demonstrates how the RELand model works for landmine detection using deep neural networks, machine learning and other AI techniques to produce probabilities of where landmines may be. It needs to work in the same way that the RELand system does using the variables such as distance from road, proximity to historical events, and also uses geospatial data/characteristics, and community variables i.e. past conflicts.

> Change the HTML code so I have the ability to insert a topographical map underneath the transparent grid squares that indicate low, medium, and high risk so that the user can see the topography of the indicated risk area.
